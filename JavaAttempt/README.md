# Overview

This is a piece of software that reads through a csv bank statement and adds up all credit and debit amounts. 

The purpose of the program is to provide an efficient way to process data from a csv file, as well as to learn how to program in Java using classes, functions, loops, arrays, bufferreader and other things.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
